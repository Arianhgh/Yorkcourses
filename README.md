            I have always seen me and my friends struggle to find the right prerequisites for our courses or to find the details of a course we want to take in the future.
            This is why I created this website, to help gather all the information in one place. It is still a work in progress and I am still adding more courses and features.
            for now, I have only added EECS courses.

        I hope you find this website useful.

        I am not affiliated with York University and this website is not official.
